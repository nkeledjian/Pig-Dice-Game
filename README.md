### This is a classic dice game that is simple and fun to play!

#### The rules are simple: 

-Roll the dice to add up your current score

-Click the hold button to add the current score you've added up to your total score

-You can keep rolling the dice but: 
* If you roll a 1 with either die, your current score will be cleared and it will be the other players turn
* Hope to whatever diety that you don't roll two 6's otherwise both your current score and total score will become 0!

-A custom winning score can also be set:

This project was part of [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) which has been a fantastic experience so far. 
The base HTML, CSS, and JS code were provided and as part of later challenges in the course, I added additional features: the 2nd die, and the custom winning score that players can set before and during the game. This is my solution to those later challenges. I enjoyed it very much and had to share!
